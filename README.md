# Internship project : FL-Minifier

## A Tool To Minify and Unify AdBlocker's Filter Lists

## Project Map

- [ ] Provide an initial state-of-the-art analysis of ad-blockers (e.g., AdBlock, μBlock, Ghostery, Privacy Badger, Disconnect).
- [ ] Understand the data pipeline and the current algorithm used in the test page.
- [ ] Build an improved version of the rule’s parser that includes cosmetic rules.
- [ ] Develop a filter-list minifier that will be used to speed up the current algorithm.
- [ ] Documentation on browser’s extensions inner working.
- [ ] Based on the previous documentation and the established constraints, define a method to include the current filter-list tracking algorithm in the AmIUnique extension.



## State of the art

### AdBlock

Let's through (whitlists) "Acceptable" ads (a fee of 30% of ad revenue is expected for ad providers who gain more than 10m impressions per month from being whitelisted [article](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/25/adblock-plus-opens-up-acceptable-ads-work)) 

### uBlock

Open Source [repo](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets)

- Ports :
  - Chrome
  - Chromium 
  - MS Edge 
  - Opera
  - Firefox 
  - Safari < v13

Community generated filter lists ([Lists](https://easylist.to/#easylist)) [r/uBlockOrigin](https://old.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/)

### Ghostery

Open Source [repo](https://github.com/ghostery/ghostery-extension) (note the tracker database is proprietary)
Lists trackers it blocks to inform the user.
Allows to unblock selected sites or trust a site to disable ghostery for this site

- Ports :
  - Firefox
  - Chrome
  - Opera
  - Edge

Implements Cliqz Ad-blocker [site](https://cliqz.com/en/whycliqz/adblocking)

### Privacy Badger

Doesn't block ads but trackers, it just so happens that lots of ads also track you.
Filter lists are generated by the software (it analyses the behaviour or certain sites and determines wether they are tracking the user).

Detects Canvas based fingerprinting and blocks corresponding sites.
